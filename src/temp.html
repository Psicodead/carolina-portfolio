            <p>The mentality of each person about family, traditions, people and stories are connected to a specific time of childhood, that invokes some sounds, colors and concrete lightings. Bodies that came to life again in this photo graphs by the use of the light that made a trip through the fading color in the walls cause of the sun, the moon, wind and water as their main amplifiers; cracks had been made by the use of the place when was inha bited, some of them are hidden and they're just noticed by the projections.</p>

                <p>Was born by 2 stories about Rico Family, La Concordia and Coacha, buildings that shared as people as photographic files that were saved by the family, that’s why a parallel can be created about what is now and what was there, the differences and similarities between people and traditions of the past there.</p>

            <p>It’s a retrospective view about the family memories in the traditional Colombia that was grown in the farms, the way they celebrate, how they shared different moments and the places of this family, being really different from now so the purpose of this is bring into the mind of the viewer their own background, no matter if they grew up in the territory of the images or not, it’s more taking in account the way that the old families shared and the atmosphere of them.</p>
            <p>This idea about farms and nature it started by the collective mentality of the common past of the Latin American people even having this background most of people had been forgot their past because they’re rushing in their life or they don’t have a certain idea of the past of their families and that traditions are already disappearing in the actuality</p>
